# Product Categories and Advanced Search - High Level Design

## Overview
Implement a hierarchical category system for organizing products and provide advanced search capabilities including full-text search, filtering, and sorting.

## System Architecture
```mermaid
graph TB
    UI[Frontend UI/Admin Panel] --> API[API Layer]
    API -- Category Mgmt --> CS[Category Service]
    API -- Search/Filter --> SS[Search Service]
    CS --> CR[Category Repository]
    SS --> SE[Search Engine (e.g., Elasticsearch, Solr)]
    SS --> PR[Product Repository] // For fallback or direct filtering
    CR --> DB[(Database)]
    PR --> DB
    DB -- Data Sync --> SE
```

## Core Components
1.  **Category Service:** Manages CRUD operations for categories, handles hierarchy, and associates products with categories.
2.  **Search Service:** Interfaces with the search engine, handles indexing, querying, filtering, faceting, and sorting.
3.  **Search Engine:** External search engine (like Elasticsearch) optimized for full-text search and complex filtering.
4.  **Data Sync Mechanism:** Keeps the search engine index up-to-date with changes in the product and category data in the main database.

## Key Features
- Hierarchical category management (parent-child relationships)
- Assign products to multiple categories
- Full-text search across product names, descriptions, attributes
- Faceted search (filtering by category, brand, price, attributes, ratings)
- Configurable sorting options
- Search suggestions/autocomplete
- Indexing of product data for fast retrieval

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/categories` (Get category tree)
- `GET /api/categories/{categoryId}/products` (Get products in a category)
- `GET /api/search?query=...&filter=...&sort=...` (Search products)
- `GET /api/search/suggestions?prefix=...` (Autocomplete)
- `GET /api/search/facets?query=...` (Get filter options based on search)
- `POST /api/admin/categories` (Admin: Create category)
- `PUT /api/admin/categories/{categoryId}` (Admin: Update category)
- `DELETE /api/admin/categories/{categoryId}` (Admin: Delete category)
- `POST /api/admin/search/reindex` (Admin: Trigger re-indexing)

## Security Considerations
- Secure admin endpoints for category management and re-indexing.
- Prevent injection attacks in search queries.
- Ensure search results respect product visibility rules (if any).

## Data Models (Conceptual)
- `Category` (Category ID, Name, Slug, Parent ID, Description, Image URL)
- `ProductCategory` (Join table: Product ID, Category ID)
- `SearchIndexDocument` (Product ID, Name, Description, Brand, Price, Categories, Attributes, Rating, Stock Status) - Structure within the Search Engine

## Future Enhancements
- Personalized search results
- Integration with machine learning for better relevance ranking
- Visual search
- More complex attribute filtering (numeric ranges, multiple selections)
